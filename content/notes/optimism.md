# Optimism

What am I optimistic about?

- The possibilty of the Community movie being completed
- Playing on my Steam Deck more
- Our bathroom remodel being completed
- Summer
- My ongoing employment

The world is weird right now. Lot's of doom and gloom. For good reason. I just wanted to share some things that I'm glass half full about.
