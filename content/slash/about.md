## Mike Helmers

<img src="./mike-helmers-profile.jpg", "Mike, in a favorite shirt.>

Hey, I'm Mike! I live in Madison, WI, with my son, my partner, and our dog. This site is my little corner of the web, where I write about what I’m learning, what I’m thinking, and whatever I feel like sharing. I'm really into the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), and I’m always tinkering with ways to make this site more connected and interactive.

### My Work Life

I work in cybersecurity, where I get to combine my love for problem-solving with the challenge of keeping systems secure. From spotting vulnerabilities to implementing strong defenses, I take pride in making tech a safer space for everyone.

### Learning & Growing

I recently earned my Masters Degree, diving deep into cybersecurity. Think stuff like network security, threat analysis, and strategies to stay one step ahead of cyberattacks. Balancing school and work is a challenge, but it keeps me sharp and up-to-date in a field that’s constantly evolving.

### My Hobbies

When I’m not buried in cybersecurity, I’m probably at a table (or online) playing Dungeons & Dragons. It’s more than just a game for me—it’s a creative outlet and a way to sharpen my problem-solving and teamwork skills while having a blast.

### What I’m Working On

I’ve always got a few projects in the works, blending my interests in tech and creativity:

- **Smart Home Setup:** Building a connected (and secure) smart home using Home Assistant and Alexa.
- **Personal Web Projects:** Designing my site with custom CSS themes—Latte, Macchiato, Frappe, Mocha, Forest, and Druid.
- **Cybersecurity Research:** Analyzing Microsoft 365 Government G3 vs. G5 licenses to figure out the best options for compliance and security.
