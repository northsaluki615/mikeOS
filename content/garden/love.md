# On Love


## Inspirations
From "The Good Place" Season 3, Episode 13 Pandemonium:
>**Eleanor:**
Hi, Janet.
Can you just, you know, like, tell me the answer? Sorry? You know, the answer to everything.
You know all there is to know in the universe.
Crunch the numbers.
Tell me the answer.
What's the point of love if it's just gonna disappear? And how is it worse to not love anybody? There has to be meaning to existence, otherwise the universe is just made of pain, and I don't like the thought of that, so tell me the answer.
**Janet:**
I know how you feel.
Back on Earth, I had to watch Jason have no recognition of me.
It felt like right before someone pushes a plunger and murders you.
Sure.
The more human I become, the less things make sense.
But that's part of the fun, right? What do you mean? If there were an answer I could give you to how the universe works, it wouldn't be special.
It would just be machinery fulfilling its cosmic design.
It would just be a big, dumb food processor.
But since nothing seems to make sense, when you find something or someone that does, it's euphoria.
In all this randomness and this pandemonium, you and Chidi found each other, and you had a life together.
