What a year. Frankly, this has been one of the most tumultuous years in my life. Throughout, I saw significant changes in my personal relationships, my career, my education, my living situation, and more. Some good, some bad, all complicated. And I'm not even getting into the fucked up political state of the US.

I think I'll just tackle these things one at a time.

## Selling Wendy Lane and Moving

### Complicated Feelings

This year I said goodbye to the first house I ever purchased. It was a lovely ranch on Wendy Ln. in Madison. It's where James took his first steps. It's where my marriage crumbled. It's where I brewed the best mead I've ever made. It's where I fell in love with Alicia. It's where I learned to start maintaining a house (an ongoing education).

Got myself a real-estate lawyer (avoiding the pesky realtor fees) and sold Wendy Lane to a friend. I gave my home a good home. They've done some incredible work, and made it a home. Frankly, this is the best possible outcome.

### Moving

This past June, I moved in with Alicia. We are in a wonderful home in Fitchburg that can accommodate us and our combined four children. The six of us spent the summer walking to the neighborhood pool, the kids going to the park, and making our new house a home.

And it is. James is walking distance to a park, pool, and his schools. Alicia created a cozy room for the kiddos where we can always find them reading, coloring, or relaxing.

## Mister James

This is a big year for James! My little guy started Kindergarten. It's crazy that he is old enough to go to school. And he loves it. I am so happy that
