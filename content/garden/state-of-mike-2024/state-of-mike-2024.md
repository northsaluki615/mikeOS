What a year. Frankly, this has been one of the more tumultuous years in my life. Throughout, I saw significant changes in my personal relationships, my career, my education, my living situation, and more. Some good, some bad, all complicated. And I'm not even getting into the fucked up political state of the US.

Alicia and I took some time to reflect on our accomplishments over the last year, and I feel this is the simplest way to go through it.

## Selling Wendy Lane and Moving

### Complicated Feelings

This year I said goodbye to the first house I ever purchased. It was a lovely ranch on Wendy Lane in Madison. It's where James took his first steps. It's where my marriage crumbled. It's where I brewed the best mead I've ever made. It's where I fell in love with Alicia. It's where I learned to start maintaining a house (an ongoing education). It's where I learned that a house is not necessarily a home, but can be. It's where I learned to have some self respect.

As my [divorce](#marriage-and-divorce) proceeded, I realized I couldn't have the life I wanted and hold onto that house. My complicated feelings on it certainly influenced this decision.

So, what happened next? Well, with some input from the ever insightful Alicia and a friend looking for a house, I sold it. Got myself a real-estate lawyer (avoiding the pesky realtor fees) and sold Wendy Lane to a friend. I gave my home a good home. They've done some incredible work, and made it a home. Frankly, this is the best possible outcome.

### Moving

This past June, I moved in with Alicia. We are in a wonderful home in Fitchburg that can accommodate us and our combined four children. The six of us spent the summer walking to the neighborhood pool, the kids going to the park, and making our new house a home.

And it is. James is walking distance to a park, pool, and his schools. Alicia created a cozy room for the kiddos where we can always find them reading, coloring, or relaxing.

This house is a home.

I feel like I belong and can take up space. It feels like mine. James has his own room and space. My art is on the walls next to Alicia's. Our Lego's share shelf space. This is a wonderful place, and I'm so pleased and happy to be here.
## Mister James

This is a big year for James! My little guy started Kindergarten. It's crazy that he is old enough to go to school. And he loves it. Watching him grow is a joy, and it has been so cool to see him learn to read. 
## Grad School

Back in the fall of 2022, I applied, and got into the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay to pursue a Masters Degree in Cybersecurity. This past December, I did it. This was tough. It took up a ton of time, and I considered dropping it multiple times as life presented obstacles to me. I'm really pleased to have finished it, and that's all there is there.
## Tim

We lost Tim this last year. I've written about it [here](https://mike.helmers.me/garden/my-brother-tim/). I still miss him, and think of him often. Please visit https://tim.helmers.me for his permanent remembrance page.
## Marriage and Divorce

Here's the big one. My divorce.
