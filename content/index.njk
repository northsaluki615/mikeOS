<h1>🍃 Mike's Digital Garden 🍃</h1>
<p>Welcome to my digital garden! Why do I call it this instead of a blog? I want this site to feel more natural and fun. It's not meant for commodity. This is where I plant seeds of ideas, nurture them, and watch them grow. I'm always learning and experimenting, so this space is a reflection of that journey. I hope you find something interesting or useful here.</p>

  <p>These are my scribbles, rants, and pontifations. Enjoy.</p>
<h2>Digital Garden Terminology</h2>
<p>This is heavily borrowed from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com">Maggie Appleton's</a> website. I've adopted a similar system to help me keep track of the ideas I'm exploring.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>🌱 Seedling</strong>: A new idea or concept that I'm exploring.</li>
<li><strong>🌿 Sprout</strong>: A seedling that has started to grow and take shape.</li>
<li><strong>🌳 Evergreen</strong>: A fully-formed idea that I've written about in detail.</li>
</ul>

As of now, I'm classifying articles/posts/notes in the following way:

- Blog Posts: These are more formal articles that I've written. They're usually longer and more thought-out.
- Notes: These are shorter, more informal posts. They're usually quick thoughts or ideas that I've jotted down. These are less likely to we well though out.
