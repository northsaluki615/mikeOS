Last year I was at Basic Training.

On this day a year ago I cried.

It was my second wedding anniversary.

I was tired, alone, and I walked through a room filled with tear gas.

Joking aside, it sucked being away from my wife.

I love the life I have with Kristin. Spending the last 5 years with her, matured the past three, has made me a happy man, better man.

I am so proud of the woman I married. Her intelligence, her strength, and compassion inspire me every day.

I love our life together and I can’t wait to see what happens over the next year.

To my wife, I love you, and I like you.

Your husband,
Michael Helmers
