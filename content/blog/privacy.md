# üîè Being Private

This came out of talking with friends who wanted to maintain their anonymity online.

Do not back up stuff to Google without explicit permission

* Consider a Google Voice number
* Sign-up for a burner email with [proton.me](https://proton.me)
* Create an account on the following:
  * Telegram
* Get a Password manager. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) is my personal recommendation.

## Your Phone

* Use photo vaults
* All pictures have EXIF data attached to them. This is geolocation, camera type, date taken, etc...
* Remove EXIF data by using an app:
  * [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif)
  * [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/exif-viewer-by-fluntro-view-remove-gps-metadata/id944118456)

## Access Control

* Do not allow users who aren't your "Friends" on sites to view your more sensitive pics (i.e., face)
* Change security settings on all social media to "friends only"
* Don't share pictures that exist in places other than Fetlife, Onlyfans, etc... (If a photo is on Facebook, don't use it elsewhere)

## Payment

* Pre-paid debit cards
* Use [privacy.com](https://privacy.com) for online payment privacy.
