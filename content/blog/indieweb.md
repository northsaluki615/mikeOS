# the indie-web
The Indieweb is like the old internet. Untethered. Disparate. Fun. It's about being in control of my presence. It's about not letting big tech control how you post, who you follow, and what you're allowed to share. It's about community blogs, not walled blogs.

## Building it out
I recently learned about [indiemarks](https://indieweb.org/IndieMark), and build my own checklist as I [indiewebify](https://indiewebify.me/) my site.

Here it is: [[indiemark]] 
## RelMe

`rel=me` html tags show ownership of sites, and help verify that you are who you say you are.


```html
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/USERNAME" rel="me">@USERNAME on Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/USERNAME" rel="me">Twitter</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:USERNAME@proton.me" rel="me">USERNAME@proton.me</a></li>
</ul>
```

## webmentions

A way to track mentions of my posts across the Internet. 

```html
<link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/mike.helmers.me/webmention" />
```
