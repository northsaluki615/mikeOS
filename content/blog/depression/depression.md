# Depression 

## Helpful Tools 

### From Dan Harmon

1. Admit and accept what is happening.
2. Try to remind yourself, over and over, that feelings are real, but they aren't reality.
3. The most important thing I can say to you is please don't deal with it alone. Output is magical.
	- Dark thoughts will echo off the walls of your skull, they will distort and magnify.
	- Vent them
