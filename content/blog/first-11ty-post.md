# Welcome to 11ty

Welcome to the weird. Welcome to my new and improving statically generated site. A few years ago I made a career change and got into IT. Many years later, I decided that my blog wasn't nerdy enough. That led me down a rabbit-hole that introduce me to SSG (Static Site Generators). These are tools that generate html to be presented as a website. There's no CMS, minimal JavaScript, and all nerd.

Around that same time, I was introduced to "Digital Gardens". You can view mine [here](mike.helmers.me/garden/). This is a living webpage that will grow and evolve over time. It's been a lot of fun to build, and I'm looking forward to have it keep going.

## What is it?

- An organic site that will grow
- A place for my thoughts, rants, and pontifications
- A journaling tool
- A weird place on the Internet
- A testing ground for the [Indieweb](https://mike.helmers.me/garden/indieweb)
- Full of my hubris
- Fun things with the Fediverse

## What isn't it?

- An SEO optimized content delivery platform
- A good example of code.

## What's here?

Has it been a minute since we talked? Want to know what I'm up to? Check out my [Now](https://mike.helmers.me/now) page.

Curious about the tools and tech I use? It's all on my [/uses](https://mike.helmers.me/uses/) page!

That's it. I think it's time to go and see what I do.
