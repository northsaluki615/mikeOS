Thoughts on my ‚ÄúGuidelines for Character Creation and Play‚Äù

Hey guys!  I will be starting a new Dragonbane campaign in a couple weeks at a local game store.  Aside from meeting one of the players one time, everyone will be complete strangers to myself and, to the best of my knowledge, each other.  Since our time will be somewhat limited (4-5ish hour sessions twice a month), I wanted to come up with some guidelines/table rules to help facilitate faster play, to encourage cooperation and collaboration, and to hopefully weed out any bad apples beforehand.  Anyways, this is what I‚Äôve come up with so far, and I was just looking for some feedback, thoughts, and opinions.  I have only ever played TTRPGs with people I know well, so this is uncharted territory for me.  Also, aside from playing a few solo scenarios just to test the waters, I have not played or ran Dragonbane.  Thanks in advance!

Guidelines for PC Creation and Play

Kin - all core races (human, halfling, dwarf, elf, mallard, wolfkin), and from the Bestiary (orc, ogre, goblin, frogmen, lizardkin).  Please note, the world is largely populated and dominated by humans. 

Heroic Abilities - players may swap out their profession‚Äôs starting heroic ability, providing it is an ability that profession would realistically know, per DM‚Äôs approval

Weaknesses - As there are nightkin that have integrated themselves into ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù society, it is strongly discouraged PCs begin play with the weakness ‚Äúintolerant‚Äù

Starting gear/encumbrance - encumbrance rules will be used.  In addition to starting gear, each PC may begin play with a chest that may be used for inventory overflow. 
Chest stats, HP 25, Armor rating 5, carries 20 wgt 

Additional PCs - players may create as many PCs as they wish, but will never control more than one at a time.  These PCs may be used as a backup in the event of a character‚Äôs death, or may be used to create a stable of PCs that may be swapped in and out

PCs MUST be willing to work with others to achieve a common goal.  No lone wolves.  

Players must come up with a reason their characters are traveling to the Misty Vale, whether it be the pursuit or riches, knowledge, or glory, to escape their past, etc

PCs will begin play already knowing each other.  It is up to the players to figure out how.  They may be childhood friends, fellow members of an adventuring guild, or any other reason the players may come up with.  

There will be NO PVP unless all parties consent.  This is nonnegotiable and will result in the offending player being kicked from the table.  

Although there is no alignment in Dragonbane, PCs must be what would in D&D be considered lawful, good, or neutral.  Chaos and evil are demonic characteristics.  Repeated acts of evil will result in the PC becoming corrupted, and henceforth will be an antagonist under the DM‚Äôs control.  

PC background/backstories - backstories are fine, but should be kept relatively simple and humble.  A PC is not going to begin play as a legendary, world-renowned hero.  A PC‚Äôs status as a hero must be earned in-game!

A final note - As DM, my rulings are final and absolute.  In order to keep the game moving, if there are any disagreements they may be discussed after the session ends.  In addition, I want to create an atmosphere of inclusion, where all are welcomed.  Therefore, the following will result in immediate removal from the group - racism, misogyny, homophobia, sexual assault, or any other topic that may be triggering to others.  Finally, please keep real world politics and religion away from the table.
