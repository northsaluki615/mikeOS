This is a story about my life. I am developing an operating system from scratch, and I am documenting the process here. The base of this site is built on the [Eleventy Starter blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

A starter repository showing how to build a blog with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site generator (using the [v2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/)).

## Build Tools
To build and develop this site, you will need the following tools:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

- npm: npm is the package manager for Node.js. It comes bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

- Eleventy: This site is built using the Eleventy static site generator. To install Eleventy, open your terminal and run the following command:

	```
	npm install -g eleventy
	```

- Git: Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code. You can download Git from the official website: [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Once you have these tools installed, you can proceed with building and developing the site.
